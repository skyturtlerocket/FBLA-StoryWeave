        <div class="storyDiv">
            On the navigation bar located at the top, there's an <b>Explore</b> button.
            From here, you can choose a story you want to explore through! <br>
            You can view the descriptions by hovering over each option on the <a href="/explore">Explore</a> page.
        </div>

        <h2>Using a story</h2>
        <div class="storyDiv">
            Each story allows a user to choose their own way through the story, by giving them options for them to choose.
            These will take the user through different outcomes in the story! <br>
            Each story allows the user to stop interacting with it by pressing the <b>STOP</b> button.<br>
            A user can skip an animation by clicking the <b>Skip Animation</b> button if you don't want to go through it.<br>
            Once you complete a story, a report will generate summarizing what happened and the choices you made.
